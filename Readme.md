# Using Machine Learning Algorithms for Methane Detection

## Algorithm for Methane Detection:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Collect sensor data from the BME688 sensor, including measurements of VOCs, humidity, temperature, and pressure.
   - Gather data in environments where methane is both present and absent.

2. **Data Labeling:**
   - Label the sensor data based on the presence or absence of methane during each measurement.
   - Manually label the data or use additional methane sensors for ground truth labeling.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Extract relevant features from the sensor data, such as statistical measures of VOC levels, humidity, temperature, and pressure over time.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Train a machine learning model using the labeled data and extracted features.
   - Use common algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks for training.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance on unseen data.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the trained model to the BME688 sensor or integrate it into a larger monitoring system.
   - The model can then predict the presence of methane based on real-time sensor data.

7. **Continuous Monitoring and Updating:**
   - Continuously monitor the performance of the deployed model and update it as necessary to maintain accuracy and reliability.

## Considerations:
- While the BME688 sensor provides valuable data, it may not be as accurate or specific as dedicated methane sensors.
- Validate the performance of the model against ground truth data and consider the limitations of using indirect measurements for methane detection.
