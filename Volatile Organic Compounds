# Breath Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)

Breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are organic chemicals found in exhaled breath, indicative of various physiological and pathological processes within the body. The composition of breath VOCs is complex and varies based on factors like diet, metabolism, health status, and environmental exposures. Although specific components may vary among individuals and over time, here are common classes of compounds detected in breath analysis:

1. **Alkanes**: Straight-chain or branched hydrocarbons like methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), and propane (C3H8).

2. **Alkenes**: Hydrocarbons with at least one carbon-carbon double bond, e.g., ethylene (C2H4) and propylene (C3H6).

3. **Alcohols**: Organic compounds with one or more hydroxyl (-OH) groups, e.g., ethanol (C2H5OH) and methanol (CH3OH).

4. **Ketones**: Organic compounds with a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two other carbon atoms, e.g., acetone (CH3COCH3) and isopropanol (C3H8O).

5. **Aldehydes**: Organic compounds with a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to at least one hydrogen atom, e.g., formaldehyde (CH2O) and acetaldehyde (C2H4O).

6. **Aromatic Hydrocarbons**: Organic compounds with one or more aromatic rings, e.g., benzene (C6H6) and toluene (C7H8).

7. **Sulfur-Containing Compounds**: Compounds with sulfur atoms, e.g., hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methanethiol (CH3SH), and dimethyl sulfide (CH3SCH3).

8. **Nitrogen-Containing Compounds**: Compounds with nitrogen atoms, e.g., ammonia (NH3) and various amines.

9. **Acids and Esters**: Organic compounds with a carboxyl group (COOH) or ester group (COO), e.g., acetic acid (CH3COOH) and methyl acetate (CH3COOCH3).

10. **Terpenes and Terpenoids**: Diverse compounds produced by plants, including monoterpenes (e.g., limonene) and sesquiterpenes (e.g., Î±-pinene).

These examples highlight the range of VOCs detected in exhaled breath. Analyzing their composition and concentrations offers valuable insights for medical diagnosis, monitoring metabolic disorders, and assessing environmental exposure to pollutants.
